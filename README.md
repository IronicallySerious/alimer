**Alimer Engine** is a cross platform 2D and 3D game engine implemented in C++11, inspired by [Urho3D](https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D) and [Ogre3D](http://www.ogre3d.org).

## Features

- Cross-platform.
- Modern graphics/rendering API using Vulkan.
- Data-Driven engine.

## Goals/Planned Features

- OpenGL 3.3 + and OpenGLES 2.0, 3.0+ support.
- Extendible Asset Pipeline.
- GLTF 2.0 support.
- .NET Core/Standard, Mono/Xamarin scripting support.

## Download

Alimer is greatly inspired by [Urho3D](https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D) and [Ogre3D](http://www.ogre3d.org), some code has been take from Urho3D library and adopted
by the engine needs, Urho3D is licensed under the [MIT](https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/blob/master/LICENSE). 

The engine uses the following third-party libraries:

- [Nothings](https://github.com/nothings/stb) single file libs.
  - [stb_image.h 2.19](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h)
  - [stb_image_write.h 1.09](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image_write.h)
- [rapidjson](https://github.com/Tencent/rapidjson)
- [SPIRV-Cross](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Cross)
- [glslang](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glslang)
- [volk Metaloader for Vulkan](https://github.com/zeux/volk)
